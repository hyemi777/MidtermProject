NMIX 4310 Midterm Project 
This app is called Crocheting Creations! I have recently picked up crocheting as a hobby and I really love it!
So this app has three buttons. The first one helps me keep track of how many stitches because some patterns require 
different stitches in the same row making it difficult to keep up with how many stitches I have already completed and how many I have left. 
The second button shows three different arts and craft stores near me in Athens. To keep it simple, I set the beginning location as UGA Tate for
all three maps. The third button shows a list of crochet projects I can tackle next along with the link to the pattern.
